# Nutlang ðŸ¥œ

The nuttiest of langs.

I am following along a book for [Writing An Interpreter In Go](https://interpreterbook.com/).

The goal is to tweak it a bit afterwards to my liking :)
(also, I would like to get it far enough to solve a couple of leetcode,
or advent of code, problems comfortably)

## Features

Currently the language supports

- integers
- booleans
- strings
- arrays
- hashes
- prefix-, infix- and index operators
- conditionals
- global and local bindings
- first-class functions
- return statements
- closures

The number of built-in functions are relatively sparse.

- len (strings and arrays)
- push
- first
- last
- rest (copy array, without the first element)
