# Nutlang ðŸ¥œ

The nuttiest of langs.

Base code from [Writing An Interpreter In Go](https://interpreterbook.com/).
You might recognize Monkey Language or similar names,
but I wanted to give it my own name.

The goal is to improve the language far enough to solve a couple of leetcode
or advent of code problems, comfortably.

## Features

After following the book I ended up with these features:

- integers
- booleans
- strings
- arrays
- hashes
- prefix-, infix- and index operators
- conditionals
- global and local bindings
- first-class functions
- return statements
- closures

The number of built-in functions are relatively sparse.

- len (strings and arrays)
- push
- first
- last
- rest (copy array, without the first element)
- puts (print to STDOUT)

### Things I want to add

This is a list of things I feel are missing for it to be considered a limited,
but still somewhat complete language

#### General features

- [x] Value Assignment (meaning re-assignment, after let statement)
  - [x] Arrays
  - [x] Hashes
  - [x] Integers
- [ ] File IO
- [x] Floats
- [ ] structs/types (some way to group items together)
- [x] <= and >=
- [ ] while/for loop
- [ ] Scan/input/read (input from STDIN)

#### Arrays

- [x] Pop
- [ ] Insert
- [ ] Remove
- [ ] Shift
- [ ] Unshift

#### Integers/Floats

- [ ] Random
- [ ] Min
- [ ] Max
- [ ] Modulo

#### Strings

- [ ] split
- [ ] trim
- [ ] startsWith
- [ ] endsWith
- [ ] includes
